Proposal for new Beets plugin

name:	m3ulist

desc:	A plugin to create m3u playlists...
		- for albums during import operations
		- for albums already in database (auto-gen one / some / all)
		- for all items returned by a custom search query

details: The plugin should...
    - allow for relative or absolute paths in a playlist file
	- output to album folder, a pre-configured global 'Playlists' folder
      or custom destination
	- add a stage to the import pipeline for albums, to generate the playlist
	- provide a stand-alone subcommand on the CLI for single/multiple album
      operations
	- hook in to the `list` command (if possible) to generate a playlist from
      a custom search query

considerations:
	- optionally include the UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM)
      [(still?) required by certain players]
	- limit the number of items allowed per playlist (or per generate operation)
      [possibly provide ability to append new/more items to an existing
       playlist file?]
	- method for updating playlist file(s) when items are updated/moved etc.
	  [preferably on-demand for an individual playlist or bulk operation from
       the CLI - i.e. search for playlist items (per playlist) and update
       using pre-configured options or interactively]
